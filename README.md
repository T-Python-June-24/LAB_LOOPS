# LAB_LOOPS


## 1) Using range(),  make a range from 45 to 210, using a for loop iterate over the sequence and print the elements. Skip the number 100 and break the loop at 205

## 2) Using a while loop and input , do the following :
- Ask the user : "what is the product of 7 * 24 ?"
- check if the answer is right then exit the loop and print "You answered this Question correctly"
- if the answer is wrong, then print "Your Answer is wrong try again.." and show the user the question again.

### Sum of Even Numbers

Write a Python program that prompts the user for a positive integer `n`, and then calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and `n`, inclusive.

Your program should use a loop (either a `for` loop or a `while` loop) to iterate over the numbers between 1 and `n`, and only add the even numbers to the sum.

For example:

```
Enter a positive integer: 10
The sum of even numbers between 1 and 10 is 30.
```

In this example, the even numbers between 1 and 10 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, and their sum is 30.
